# FSM-Verilog
# This is a Door Lock Project designed to run on the Basys 3 Artix-7 FPGA as it is, or can be used on other FPGAs with changes in the Constraint File.
# It has been coded such that the Door Lock Pattern can be set in real time using the switches already present on the Board.
# The idea of a Finite State Machine (FSM) has been used to implement this
